# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sergiospinto
#### I started my career as a software tester, during that period I acquired experience in requirement analysis and product functional behaviour which helped me a lot identifying the most common issues in software development. 

### Now I am a Software Engineer In Test working with a devops mindset.

I can develop software in any programming language given the right adaptation time - full stack - as well as working in operationsâ€™ tasks, for example, CI/CD and assembling tool chains.

I was always appointed by my peers as an organised person who follows method and logic to solve problems, as a communicative person who can transmit as well as receive information in a adaptable manner and also as a team player who works for the benefit of the project as a whole.
