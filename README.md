# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sergiospinto
### I am a software engineer in test with a devops mindset. 

Having a passion for delivering high-quality software, I have honed my skills through a career that has taken me from software testing to a full-stack software engineer with a focus on quality assurance. My background in requirement analysis and product functional behavior provides a strong understanding of the most common issues in software development, enabling problem-solving with method and logic.

I am a versatile software engineer with experience in a range of programming languages, as well as in CI/CD and tool chain assembly. My peers have consistently praised me for my ability to communicate effectively and work collaboratively as part of a team, always striving for the best outcome for the project as a whole.

Organization and adaptability are hallmarks of my professional approach, coupled with a strong devops mindset. This comprehensive approach to software development and operations has been honed through years of experience. Confidence in developing software in any language with the right amount of time and effort, combined with a desire to tackle new challenges and continuously learn new skills, makes me an eager candidate for new opportunities.
